# Program to do anything.  You try to  tell it what to do and it works
# with you to  figure out exactly what you want to  do.  This way, you
# don't  have to  go looking  for functionality.   I don't  know where
# exactly this belongs, so it's in unilang for now.

# examples:  I want to upload code to cpan.
# ...radar -u or somethign
