Chapter 1. What is UniLang?

Overview

   UniLang is an attempt to speed interaction by providing a common
   format to all communications. For instance, if you type in a SubL
   expression, it will be routed to Cyc. If you type in a question, it
   will be sent to the best question answering service. If you write down
   a todo item, it will be entered into the apropriate plan.

   It is an extension of eshell, the emacs shell, which already lets you
   either run shell or emacs commands in a convenient format.

   It integrates with many of the existing applications that we are
   developing, such as Manager, PSE, Audience and so on.
