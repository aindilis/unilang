>&#13;	There  are several  different types  of software  systems that
	MyFRDCSA has to  deal with effectively.  At this  time Thu Jan
	29 21:47:19 EST 2004,  there are: {locally developed software,
	existing debian packages,  other system packages, and upstream
	software} Of  upstream software, we would  like to distinguish
	based on license type.  We  figure, if we've found the system,
	and if  it checks  out as being  worthwhile, we would  like to
	make  its  functionality  available.   If  it is  able  to  be
	packaged  for  Debian  immediately,  great.   If  it  contains
	licensing  problems we  will  research these  and contact  the
	appropriate groups  to determine  if they can  relicense their
	software  to be  free.  If  it cannot  be relicensed,  we will
	engage  in a  legal  method  of attempting  to  create a  free
	version   of  it,   where   possible.   If   it  is   licensed
	restrictively, we will probably keep it on record but will not
	redistribute it.  We  will attempt if possible to  apply it to
	the cause of free software,  a necessary evil.  But of course,
	we will always  try to follow the policy  that has made Debian
	among the purest and most capable systems available.

>&#13;	  Upstream software  and locally developed  software must both
	  be  made  into   Debian  packages.   Therefore,  the  actual
	  machinery that makes these  ought to be treated differently.
	  Therefore  RADAR primarily  handles  upstream software,  and
	  whatever else handles locally developed software.

>&#13;	  Locally  developed  software is  treated  no different  than
	  upstream software, except  that the environment for creating
	  it is provided.  Currently this  is one we have written, and
	  we  are in  the  process of  modelling  the semantics  using
	  OpenCyc.  However, since an object oriented model might also
	  apply, I  might try  learning and using  UML for  this task.
	  The  Debian  package  Gforge  is another  environment  which
	  integrates  project management effectively.   We are  in the
	  process of testing this to see whether it is suitable to our
	  needs.
