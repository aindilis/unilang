Add the ability to Clear to translate mathematical symbols into their English equivalent and read aloud.  i.e. "For any F , suppose that there exists some Z with {F} ∪ Z = Z1 if and only if there also exists some Z such that {F} ∪ Z = Z2. Then F ∈ Z1" should get translated into whatever is appropriate.  This should be enabled by some flag, has_math or something, of which there could be many kinds for the many different symbol systems in use, and could be automatically detected.
