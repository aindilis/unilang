(Chelitis: This is  crusting and cracking which occurs  in the corners
of the  mouth.  It is  caused by a  fungus and anti-fungal  creams are
usually curative.)

Here are some of the features needed:

Interaction manager,  so for instance,  say RADAR wants to  check with
the user about something, should the user be notified.

Also, modules need to have  a well defined behaviour, for instance, if
we ask RADAR  to ammortize its requests, instead  of checking in every
so  often.   This  could  be  done by  setting  certain  communication
permissions, severity levels,  etc.  All of this should  be handled by
some sort  of interactive  planner.  So, different  message priorities
should be considered.

Perhaps should consider the work of the Radar, Calo, and Pal projects,
which no doubt have considered these things.  Should make links to AFS
dirs for these.

An incidental  advantage of this  design, or an exapted  advantage, or
just more  evidence of its  correct layout, is  that this tool  can be
used to manage threads of  thought.  For instance, I was thinking that
I add to my other document  (which I'm not supposed to because writing
to  justify myself  to others  is considered  a bad  habit),  but that
because  I lack  certain  abilities, that  it  makes it  extraordinary
complex  and difficult  for me  to implement  them, (because  they are
almost necessary to  be able implement themselves -  chicken and egg.)
But then, on  the other hand once this gets done,  you have in essence
done all  this difficult,  important work which  now results  in great
abundance and well-being  - like the politician who  works his way up.
Only,     there     is    no     fear     of     the    results     of
succession!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! because its a
program and never dies of old age.

So, I suppose there is a large KB end to this, anchoring thoughts into
KBs, translation, the works.  Meaning  that since those are related to
organization of thought there is a certain necessary connection there.
Maybe a stipulation  ought to be that in all but  very rare cases, the
thought must be associated with a FORMAL expression of its meaning.  A
semantic web.

# this is a MAS

# this is work  now on making sure that the log  files are safe.  That
# is  probably most  important.   Analysis of  logfiles that  happened
# before the  system was completely erected can  now, quite naturally,
# be  rerun through the  system in  order to  have it  reallocate that
# information.  There should  therefore before unique identifiers that
# allow  it  to  extract  the   existing  assertion  for  a  piece  of
# information, and reinsert it properly.  You can see I am treating my
# very notes as  if they were the powerful UniLang  itself.  Oh boy oh
# boy.

# New tool  for people  who think in  stream of consciousness.   We have
# implemented this tool which parses a dialog with a person and puts the
# information  they generate  into the  proper location,  and formalizes
# parts of it, and combines this  with a planner, to make sure that they
# achieve what they say, or if not, can at least record in a correct and
# intelligent manner.
#
# This is a great tool for those who generate great amounts of writings,
# like Autists, Schizophrenics, and so forth.
#
# The  unique   and  powerful  capabilities  that  it   allows  are  not
# coincidental,  they  are part  of  a  very  large integrated  research
# project  into AI that  was initiated  5 years  ago as  a result  of my
# abnormalities and  brain dysfunction, as  well as the  unique insights
# into  actual functioning that  I was  forced to  make by  lacking, but
# being  held  to  the  same  standard  as  neurotypicals  for,  certain
# abilities.
#
# Ask Rachel if  she can pick me up some slippers,  and cheap ear muffs,
# if possible, with my credit card.
#
# Dear  Al, 
#
#   I  have had  some good  success with  my system  here, it  is really
# taking  off. Of  course it  will still  be a  while, but  I  wanted to
# mention some things.
#
#   In telling  Rachel about how it  took 10 years to  solve the Sussman
# anomoly, that is, that thing with blocks C, B on A, an you want A on B
# on C, and it does it  suboptimally with linear planning, I realized an
# argument that  illustrates the mentality  that was in  dispute between
# Jason and I.
#
#   I told  her that  at first  I didn't realize  that toy  domains like
# blocks  world were  themselves the  objects of  open problems.   I had
# assumed only that they illustrated points about planning.
#
#   I told  her about  the Sussman  anomoly, as well  as the  failure of
# linear  solvers to  solve the  UPS World,  where you  have to  fly two
# objects to another airport, but that linear planners naively would fly
# only one object at a time, and couldn't solve the problem because they
# would run out of gas, because of the way they treated the relationship
# between operators and world state.
#
#   In describing  these, I said  that, while they seem  simplistic, the
# actual problems that  affect us now are no less  simplistic and from a
# viewpoint  of  a sufficiently  intelligent  being,  they  are just  as
# simplistic as the toy problems.
#
#   I tolder her that my  intention was to eliminate these problems, and
# I mentioned  about how  animals for instance  will eat each  other.  I
# told her that  I watched things like  that to remind me that  it is no
# different outside  of our  doors.  I said  I was against  all predator
# activity.
#
#   I said for instance, when I told Jason that with AI, everybody could
# be a  grandmaster, he said  but what does  that get you.  I  said, and
# then  I realized the  exact truth  in it,  that this  illustrates that
# Jason  has no  concern except  a predatory  one.  In  other  words, he
# doesn't have  to run faster than the  bear, he has only  to run faster
# than the other person.
#
#   I realized this  exactly explains the mentality, and  that he had no
# concern about  the racing bear, i.e.  the store closing,  only that he
# himself was OK.
#
#   This then leads me to finally  understand that my concern for him is
# not reciprocated.   There is a lot  of truth in  these statements.  At
# long last, I have come to mathematical understanding of this topic.
