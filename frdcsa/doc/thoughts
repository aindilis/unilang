Here are some of the features needed:

Interaction manager,  so for instance,  say RADAR wants to  check with
the user about something, should the user be notified.

Also, modules need to have  a well defined behaviour, for instance, if
we ask RADAR  to ammortize its requests, instead  of checking in every
so  often.   This  could  be  done by  setting  certain  communication
permissions, severity levels,  etc.  All of this should  be handled by
some sort  of interactive  planner.  So, different  message priorities
should be considered.

Perhaps should consider the work of the Radar, Calo, and Pal projects,
which no doubt have considered these things.  Should make links to AFS
dirs for these.

An incidental  advantage of this  design, or an exapted  advantage, or
just more  evidence of its  correct layout, is  that this tool  can be
used to manage threads of  thought.  For instance, I was thinking that
I add to my other document  (which I'm not supposed to because writing
to  justify myself  to others  is considered  a bad  habit),  but that
because  I lack  certain  abilities, that  it  makes it  extraordinary
complex  and difficult  for me  to implement  them, (because  they are
almost necessary to  be able implement themselves -  chicken and egg.)
But then, on  the other hand once this gets done,  you have in essence
done all  this difficult,  important work which  now results  in great
abundance and well-being  - like the politician who  works his way up.
Only,     there     is    no     fear     of     the    results     of
succession!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! because its a
program and never dies of old age.

So, I suppose there is a large KB end to this, anchoring thoughts into
KBs, translation, the works.  Meaning  that since those are related to
organization of thought there is a certain necessary connection there.
Maybe a stipulation  ought to be that in all but  very rare cases, the
thought must be associated with a FORMAL expression of its meaning.  A
semantic web.

# this is a MAS

# this is work  now on making sure that the log  files are safe.  That
# is  probably most  important.   Analysis of  logfiles that  happened
# before the  system was completely erected can  now, quite naturally,
# be  rerun through the  system in  order to  have it  reallocate that
# information.  There should  therefore before unique identifiers that
# allow  it  to  extract  the   existing  assertion  for  a  piece  of
# information, and reinsert it properly.  You can see I am treating my
# very notes as  if they were the powerful UniLang  itself.  Oh boy oh
# boy.

# New tool  for people  who think in  stream of consciousness.   We have
# implemented this tool which parses a dialog with a person and puts the
# information  they generate  into the  proper location,  and formalizes
# parts of it, and combines this  with a planner, to make sure that they
# achieve what they say, or if not, can at least record in a correct and
# intelligent manner.
#
# This is a great tool for those who generate great amounts of writings,
# like Autists, Schizophrenics, and so forth.
#
# The  unique   and  powerful  capabilities  that  it   allows  are  not
# coincidental,  they  are part  of  a  very  large integrated  research
# project  into AI that  was initiated  5 years  ago as  a result  of my
# abnormalities and  brain dysfunction, as  well as the  unique insights
# into  actual functioning that  I was  forced to  make by  lacking, but
# being  held  to  the  same  standard  as  neurotypicals  for,  certain
# abilities.
