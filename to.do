(We can have UniLang systems sending each other salient
 information in either textual, or semantic form.
 (So if someone's unilang learns about something interesting, and
  it thinks the others don't know about it, and it is safe, etc,
  send it.
  (This should be handled by two systems: socbot, and audience.)
  (Socbot models what it thinks other people know, querying as needed
   (It can even transmit to other socbot's it's own models for
    their perusal, and to try to establish consensus.  of course,
    perspectives are possible, and reasonbase necessary in this case)

   (differentiate from what people are thought to know and what
   they themselves (appear) to have said, also track the
   accumulation of errors, by always quoting source documents.
   And do not take documents out of context, specifically have a
   system that tries to detect when quotes are taken out of
   context and also, when they are being maliciously taken out of
   context)
   )

(Clear should make use of audience.  It can read to local or
 remote people.  It should formalize what it is reading and assert
 it in the user's knowledge model)

(QUAC should listen to Audience for Speech Acts that are
 questions, and if deemed necessary, attempt to resolve them)

(Digilib should passively monitor texts, scouring for the
 latest "trending" topics, developing more knowledge about these
 topics)

(Termios or its replacement should be sure to unified search
 google words and phrases it doesn't know, with additional
 context as needed)
